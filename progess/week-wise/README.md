# Week wise progress report. 

I made this section so that I can keep record of what I've been doing this week. What I have learned and what I have planned to learn in future. It will be in basic logs format with checks lists graphs and other things. Overall I think it's a nice idea to keep this kind of report. It will really help me learning about my learning pace and achievements over the time.

I will start my week from Monday and End them up on Sunday. So that way I will write reports each Sunday.
