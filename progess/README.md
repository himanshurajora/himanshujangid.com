# Progress reports

I know I am no more in school. But trust me this is a nice way to track yourself. I am not doing it in the school's way. I am not only keeping number such as hours of code and projects. But also hobbies, future plans and additional logs.
This will really help me to analyse myself in bigger time periods such as weeks and months and even years.

I kept two types of progress reports for now.
- Weekly: [[progess/week-wise/README]]
- Monthly

I might extends them in future to be Daily and yearly as well. But it's good enough for current requirements.
