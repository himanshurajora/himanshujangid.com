I write a lot. As a fact, I like writing. So there is a section in this portfolio blogs. And you are reading the `README` of that section. 

The blogs section is quite different from snippets. In the concept of snippet I don't write more than a page with little explanation and code attached to it. Instead I explain a concept completely (at least I try to).

The list of blogs is the following: 
- [[Tmux for productivity]]
- [[Markdown editor in react]]
- [[The Hundred Things Principle]]
