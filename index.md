## About

### A Small Story
   
I started my journey in programming with C# and made a lot of Console Applications and Games using Unity Game Engine to learn the basic concepts. Then I started learning HTML, CSS and PHP while I was not aware of JavaScript but indirectly using it. I just had some rough idea about it because I was using JQuery along with PHP. I worked on many projects with PHP, Learned MySQL database, Web hosting, CPanel, Domain Registration, and much more. Then I finally started using Javascript and I liked it so much that I made it my main programming language that I use daily. I have been working on ReactJS, NodeJS, Angular, NextJS, and many more JavaScript frameworks and platforms. Since then I have been working on many web projects and have been learning new things. I and also working with some extra skills like React Native, Python, Git, C, Firebase, MongoDB, Computer Graphics, Operating Systems etc.
