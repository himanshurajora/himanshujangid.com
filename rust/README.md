# Rust 
A programming language for me. I have been coding in JavaScript (TypeScript) for past 4 years. JavaScript is a wonderful programming language, I don't doubt that. However if you know JavaScript, you can tell how unpredictable it is. But when Rust came to my life, I started dreaming again. It is an amazing programming language. I write a lot of code in it and I am in love with it. Definitely it will be my girlfriend for a few years in future.

In this section I will share a lot of rust code, like seriously a lot of code.
